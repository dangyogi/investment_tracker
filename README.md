# investment_tracker
Help with rebalancing my investments.

Uses django/python.

Focuses on your investment plan and bringing you current account back to your
plan.  Also allows a "fudge factor" to raise the percentage of U.S. funds
if the market is quite low.  When you do this, it takes the needed money from
bonds (not cash).  Thus, it supports a form of aggressive rebalancing, when
desired.

I am only running this on my home network for my own use.  Right now still
using sqlite3 database...  I have no intensions for taking this to prime time.

But if think you might be able to make it work for you, clone it and have some
fun with it!
